<br> <em>Achievement is something that require a lot of efforts and commitment in life</em>. My achievement started when I was in Primary School. Starting from Primary One (1) to Primary Six (6).</br>
<br> After all in Primary School, I successfully achieved my Primary School Leaving Certificate, which I considered as a great achievement.</br>
<br> Then stepped on Secondary School where I was selected as one of the School Representatives and won the different gifts and prizes for participating in some quiz competition.</br>
<br> In short, gradually I was admitted into Higher Institution, one of the greatest University in Nigeria named Kwara State University here in Malete. </br>
<br> I can courageously say that, this is my best ever achievement.</br>
